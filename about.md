I am a self-taught programmer. I studied engineering science in university (BASc Nanotechnology Engineering '15 and MASc Chemical Engineering '17 at UWaterloo) and currently work as a data scientist in Kitchener-Waterloo.

I like programming, math and science. I am interested in using interactivity and visualization to assist in teaching difficult concepts. See [Bret Victor's Kill Math series](http://worrydream.com/KillMath/) and [Amit Patel's introduction to the A* algorithm](http://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html) for some related ideas and demos.

I am also interested in language. I taught myself Japanese over the course of 6 years, without ever taking a class, and eventually did an 8-month internship at NTT Basic Research Laboratories in Atsugi. My Japanese is still far from perfect, but my vocabulary is big enough that I was able to do my job and enjoy daily life without trouble. I would like to learn a few other languages, but I haven't decided which to tackle first.

If you want to get in contact, feel free to send me an email. My GMail name is metavee.writes.
